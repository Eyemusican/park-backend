# ByteTrack Configuration for Smart Parking System
# Optimized for accurate detection and stable tracking

tracker_type: bytetrack      # Use ByteTrack algorithm

# Detection thresholds (tuned for accuracy)
track_high_thresh: 0.25      # Higher = fewer false positives (was 0.1)
track_low_thresh: 0.10       # Second-stage threshold for recovery (was 0.05)
new_track_thresh: 0.5        # Stricter new track creation (was 0.4)

# Track persistence
track_buffer: 60             # Keep lost tracks for 60 frames (~4 seconds at 15fps, was 90)
                             # Faster cleanup = less memory, more accurate

# Matching
match_thresh: 0.8            # Stricter matching to prevent ID switches (was 0.7)
fuse_score: True             # Fuse detection score with IoU for stable matching

# Additional filtering (supported by Ultralytics)
min_box_area: 3000           # Filter tiny detections (noise)
